                Hi there! I'm Angel, I'm a self-taught frontend web developer
                who never stops learning. Welcome to my personal web porfolio, I
                would like to show you my work &#128513;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I completed my Bachelor of Accounting and Business
                Administration, since I was little I was interested in
                technology. From the age of 14 I started managing communities on
                Facebook, creating content for fun and gaining followers. At the
                age of 19, I saw a business opportunity in it and began to
                monetize visits through Google AdSense and the Facebook Audience
                Network.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how one thing led to another, and I ended up learning
                HTML and SEO copywriting to create better articles. That was my
                first contact with programming (Ok, I know HTML is not a
                programming language, but I felt like a hacker at the time, you
                know what I mean &#128527;).
            </p>
            <p>
                Time passed, with my first income I changed my old computer that
                had a broken screen and its keyboard did not work well, Windows
                XP and 2 GB of RAM. With my new computer I started to learn new
                skills on my own, I learned to use Photoshop, Paint Tool Sai,
                Sony Vegas, Audacity, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a lot of time working on things from home, I had to
                reinvent myself several times to keep making money without
                leaving home due to a powerful reason... My mother suffers from
                a mental illness, schizophrenia, for as long as I can remember,
                and she cannot stay alone. My father works all day away from
                home because he is a builder &#128170;. It was my duty to stay and take
                care of the house, so I could not start my university studies
                either.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the time I spent alone I developed a strong
                self-taught instinct. I can say that everything I learned was of
                my own free will. Reading, looking for resources, practicing
                until I improve my skills. I became a professional Google
                searcher &#128514;.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent times I became passionate about web development, I
                have been learning and creating my own projects for a long time.
                Right now I feel empowered to take responsibility and work. I
                would love for us to work together! &#x1F929;
